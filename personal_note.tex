\begin{rubric}{Personal statement}{

\entry* 
  I am a technologist by heart, and I like tinkering with toys,
  symbols, concepts, and viewpoints. On the other hand, I am a
  concerned human being. I worry about the future, and I find the
  current lack of liberty and suffering in the world is inadmissible.

  Because of that my objective is to work in a challenging and dynamic
  environment that allows me to help in making the world a better
  place by meaningful research and products.
