\begin{rubric}{Personal statement}{

    \entry* 

I am a technologist by heart. By that I mean that I like tinkering with toys,
symbols and concepts, to break, mold and assembly them in new and old formats.

But at the same time I am a concerned human being. I worry about the future, and
I find that the current world lack of liberty and suffering, both physical and mental, is
inadmissible. 

So my personal project is always aimed at working in exciting places where toys
and symbols are free to grab, but that has a direction of real, personal
positive impact to real people, living real lives.
