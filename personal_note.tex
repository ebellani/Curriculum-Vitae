    \entry*

    I believe that individual freedom is a necessary condition for
happiness. Because of that I usually prefer to work in places where
the management structure is such that incentives are used instead of
direct control, and with projects that would lead to solutions that
have what I think are intrinsic values. Those factors have the side
effect of attracting to the project the best professionals, and
working with such people is one of my major career goals.
