\begin{rubric}{Personal statement}{

\entry*

I am a humanist by heart, and I like to play with toys, symbols,
concepts, and viewpoints. On the other hand, I am a concerned human
being that worries about the future, and I find the lack of liberty in
the world inadmissible.

  Because of that, my objective is to work in a challenging and
  dynamic environment that allows me to help in making the world a
  better place by producing meaningful research and products.  }
