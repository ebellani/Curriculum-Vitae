\entry*

I am a research engineer by trade, and a storyteller by vocation.

I believe that individual freedom and honor are necessary conditions
for my personal fulfillment. Because of that I usually prefer to work
in places where:

\begin{itemize}
\item The management structure is such that incentives are used
instead of direct control
\item The projects align with my core personal values of liberty and
prosperity.
\end{itemize}
