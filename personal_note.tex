\begin{rubric}{Personal statement}{

    \entry* 
I am a technologist by heart, and I like tinkering with toys,
symbols, concepts, and viewpoints.

But at the same time I am a concerned human being. I worry about the
future, and I find that in our world the current lack of liberty and
suffering, both physical and mental, is inadmissible.

So my personal project is always aimed at working in exciting places
where people are encouraged to play and explore, but that at the same
time has a direction, a goal where there is personal positive impact
to real people, living real lives.
