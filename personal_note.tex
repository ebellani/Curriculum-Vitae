\begin{rubric}{Personal statement}{

\entry* 
  I am a technologist by heart, and I like tinkering with toys,
  symbols, concepts, and viewpoints.

  On the other hand, I am a concerned human being. I worry about the
  future, and I find that in our world the current lack of liberty and
  suffering, both physical and mental, is inadmissible.

  On the tool side, I am into diverse paradigms of thinking. I consider
  object orientation one of many points of view to adopt while working
  in a problem. Currently I am pretty involved with lisp and its
  dialects, but I would consider any language if it fits the job.
