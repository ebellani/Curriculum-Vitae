\begin{rubric}{Personal statement}{

    \entry* 
I am a technologist by heart, and I like tinkering with toys,
symbols, concepts, and viewpoints.

On the other hand, I am a concerned human being. I worry about the
future, and I find that in our world the current lack of liberty and
suffering, both physical and mental, is inadmissible.
