    \entry*

    I believe that individual freedom leads to prosperity, peace, and
happiness. Because of that I usually prefer to work in places where
the management structure is such that incentives are used instead of
control. This has the good side effect of attracting the best professionals, and working with such people is one of my major career goals.
