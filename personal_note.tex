\entry*

    I believe that individual freedom is a necessary condition for
happiness. Because of that I usually prefer to work in places where:

\begin{itemize}
\item The management structure is such that incentives are used
instead of direct control
\item The projects align with my core personal values of liberty and
prosperity.
\end{itemize}

    Those factors have the side effect of attracting to a company
great professionals, and working with such people is one of my major
career goals.
