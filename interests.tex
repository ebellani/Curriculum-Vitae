    \entry* \textbf{Law of accelerating returns}: All my research interests were
    in some way shaped by the vision of Ray Kurzweil about the possibilities of
    the future and his analysis of the exponential growth of technology and the
    impact of that growth on our societies and way of life. To get the felling,
    here is a nice introductory
    \href{http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ray_kurzweil_on_how_technology_will_transform_us.html}{video}.


    \entry* \textbf{Nanotechnology}: I'm interested on the possibility of
    programmable materials on the nano scale, and their possible impact on
    everyday life. This interest was sparked by the works of Robert Freitas and
    his excellent Nanomedicine book and by K. Eric Drexler's Engines of
    Creation, a pretty excellent book on it. 

    \entry* \textbf{Technology\&Education}: The works of Papert and his colleges
    at the MIT media lab inspired me to pursue ways to integrate constructionism
    with the Brazilian superior education.

    {Here} is a link for the article (it's work in progress, so any review is
    appreciated). If you never heard of Papert, I urge you to check his book
    Mindstorms and take a look at some of
    \href{http://homepage.mac.com/stager/iMovieTheater23.html}{his}
    \href{https://logothings.wikispaces.com/}{lectures}.

    \entry* \textbf{Brain/Machine Interface\&AI}: Due to the contact with
    Papert's philosophies and also Marvin Minsky's book, The Society of the
    Mind, and watching professor \href{http://www.nicolelislab.net/}{Nicolelis}
    speak.
